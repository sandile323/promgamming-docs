### Labeled statement
A label provides a statement with an identifier that lets you refer to it elsewhere in your program. For example, you can use a label to identify a loop, and then use the break or continue statements to indicate whether a program should interrupt the loop or continue its execution.

The syntax of the labeled statement looks like the following:


```js
label:
  statement
```

The value of label may be any JavaScript identifier that is not a reserved word. The statement that you identify with a label may be any statement. For examples of using labeled statements, see the examples of break and continue below.

### break statement
Use the break statement to terminate a loop, switch, or in conjunction with a labeled statement.

When you use break without a label, it terminates the innermost enclosing while, do-while, for, or switch immediately and transfers control to the following statement.
When you use break with a label, it terminates the specified labeled statement.
The syntax of the break statement looks like this:

```js
break;
break label;
```

The first form of the syntax terminates the innermost enclosing loop or switch.
The second form of the syntax terminates the specified enclosing labeled statement.

## Example 2: Breaking to a label

```js
let x = 0;
let z = 0;
labelCancelLoops: while (true) {
  console.log("Outer loops:", x);
  x += 1;
  z = 1;
  while (true) {
    console.log("Inner loops:", z);
    z += 1;
    if (z === 10 && x === 10) {
      break labelCancelLoops;
    } else if (z === 10) {
      break;
    }
  }
}
```

### continue statement
The continue statement can be used to restart a while, do-while, for, or label statement.

When you use continue without a label, it terminates the current iteration of the innermost enclosing while, do-while, or for statement and continues execution of the loop with the next iteration. In contrast to the break statement, continue does not terminate the execution of the loop entirely. In a while loop, it jumps back to the condition. In a for loop, it jumps to the increment-expression.
When you use continue with a label, it applies to the looping statement identified with that label.
The syntax of the continue statement looks like the following:

```js

continue;
continue label;

```

Example 1
The following example shows a while loop with a continue statement that executes when the value of i is 3. Thus, n takes on the values 1, 3, 7, and 12.

```js

let i = 0;
let n = 0;
while (i < 5) {
  i++;
  if (i === 3) {
    continue;
  }
  n += i;
  console.log(n);
}
// Logs:
// 1 3 7 12

```
If you comment out the continue;, the loop would run till the end and you would see 1,3,6,10,15.
