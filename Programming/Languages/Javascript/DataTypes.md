### Enhanced Object literals

Object literals support a range of shorthand syntaxes that include setting the prototype at construction, shorthand for foo: foo assignments, defining methods, making super calls, and computing property names with expressions.

Together, these also bring object literals and class declarations closer together, and allow object-based design to benefit from some of the same conveniences.

```js

const obj = {
  // __proto__
  __proto__: theProtoObj,
  // Shorthand for 'handler: handler'
  handler,
  // Methods
  toString() {
    // Super calls
    return "d " + super.toString();
  },
  // Computed (dynamic) property names
  ["prop_" + (() => 42)()]: 42,
};

```

### Template literals (Template strings)

Template literals are literals delimited with backtick (`) characters, allowing for multi-line strings, string interpolation with embedded expressions, and special constructs called tagged templates.

Template literals are sometimes informally called template strings, because they are used most commonly for string interpolation (to create strings by doing substitution of placeholders). However, a tagged template literal may not result in a string; it can be used with a custom tag function to perform whatever operations you want on the different parts of the template literal.

Syntax

```js

`string text`

`string text line 1
 string text line 2`

`string text ${expression} string text`

tagFunction`string text ${expression} string text`

```
### Tagged templates (Strings)

A more advanced form of template literals are tagged templates.

Tags allow you to parse template literals with a function. The first argument of a tag function contains an array of string values. The remaining arguments are related to the expressions.

The tag function can then perform whatever operations on these arguments you wish, and return the manipulated string. (Alternatively, it can return something completely different, as described in one of the following examples.)

The name of the function used for the tag can be whatever you want.

```js
const person = "Mike";
const age = 28;

function myTag(strings, personExp, ageExp) {
  const str0 = strings[0]; // "That "
  const str1 = strings[1]; // " is a "
  const str2 = strings[2]; // "."

  const ageStr = ageExp > 99 ? "centenarian" : "youngster";

  // We can even return a string built using a template literal
  return `${str0}${personExp}${str1}${ageStr}${str2}`;
}

const output = myTag`That ${person} is a ${age}.`;

console.log(output);
// That Mike is a youngster.
```
