### Constructer

To define an object type, create a function for the object type that specifies its name, properties, and methods. For example, suppose you want to create an object type for cars. You want this type of object to be called Car, and you want it to have properties for make, model, and year. To do this, you would write the following function:

```js
function Car(make, model, year) {
  this.make = make;
  this.model = model;
  this.year = year;
}

```

Instantiation:

```js
const kenscar = new Car("Nissan", "300ZX", 1992);
const vpgscar = new Car("Mazda", "Miata", 1990);
```

### Using the Object.create() method
Objects can also be created using the Object.create() method. This method can be very useful, because it allows you to choose the prototype object for the object you want to create, without having to define a constructor function.

```js

// Animal properties and method encapsulation
const Animal = {
  type: "Invertebrates", // Default value of properties
  displayType() {
    // Method which will display type of Animal
    console.log(this.type);
  },
};

// Create new animal type called animal1
const animal1 = Object.create(Animal);
animal1.displayType(); // Logs: Invertebrates

// Create new animal type called fish
const fish = Object.create(Animal);
fish.type = "Fishes";
fish.displayType(); // Logs: Fishes

```
