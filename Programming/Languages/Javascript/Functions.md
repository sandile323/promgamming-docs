### Function hoisting
Consider the example below:

```js

console.log(square(5)); // 25

function square(n) {
  return n * n;
}

```

This code runs without any error, despite the square() function being called before it's declared. This is because the JavaScript interpreter hoists the entire function declaration to the top of the current scope, so the code above is equivalent to:

Function hoisting only works with function declarations — not with function expressions. The following code will not work:

```js

console.log(square(5)); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'square' before initialization
const square = function (n) {
  return n * n;
};

```

Recursive function example:

```js

function walkTree(node) {
  if (node === null) {
    return;
  }
  // do something with node
  for (let i = 0; i < node.childNodes.length; i++) {
    walkTree(node.childNodes[i]);
  }
}

```

### Nested functions and closures

You may nest a function within another function. The nested (inner) function is private to its containing (outer) function.

It also forms a closure. A closure is an expression (most commonly, a function) that can have free variables together with an environment that binds those variables (that "closes" the expression).

Since a nested function is a closure, this means that a nested function can "inherit" the arguments and variables of its containing function. In other words, the inner function contains the scope of the outer function.

To summarize:

The inner function can be accessed only from statements in the outer function.
The inner function forms a closure: the inner function can use the arguments and variables of the outer function, while the outer function cannot use the arguments and variables of the inner function.
The following example shows nested functions:

```js

function addSquares(a, b) {
  function square(x) {
    return x * x;
  }
  return square(a) + square(b);
}

console.log(addSquares(2, 3)); // 13
console.log(addSquares(3, 4)); // 25
console.log(addSquares(4, 5)); // 41

```
Since the inner function forms a closure, you can call the outer function and specify arguments for both the outer and inner function:

```js

function outside(x) {
  function inside(y) {
    return x + y;
  }
  return inside;
}

const fnInside = outside(3); // Think of it like: give me a function that adds 3 to whatever you give it
console.log(fnInside(5)); // 8
console.log(outside(3)(5)); // 8

```

### Multiply-nested functions
Functions can be multiply-nested. For example:

A function (A) contains a function (B), which itself contains a function (C).
Both functions B and C form closures here. So, B can access A, and C can access B.
In addition, since C can access B which can access A, C can also access A.
Thus, the closures can contain multiple scopes; they recursively contain the scope of the functions containing it. This is called scope chaining. (The reason it is called "chaining" is explained later.)

Consider the following example:

```js

function A(x) {
  function B(y) {
    function C(z) {
      console.log(x + y + z);
    }
    C(3);
  }
  B(2);
}
A(1); // Logs 6 (which is 1 + 2 + 3)

```
In this example, C accesses B's y and A's x.

This can be done because:

B forms a closure including A (i.e., B can access A's arguments and variables).
C forms a closure including B.
Because C's closure includes B and B's closure includes A, then C's closure also includes A. This means C can access both B and A's arguments and variables. In other words, C chains the scopes of B and A, in that order.
The reverse, however, is not true. A cannot access C, because A cannot access any argument or variable of B, which C is a variable of. Thus, C remains private to only B.

### Name conflicts
When two arguments or variables in the scopes of a closure have the same name, there is a name conflict. More nested scopes take precedence. So, the innermost scope takes the highest precedence, while the outermost scope takes the lowest. This is the scope chain. The first on the chain is the innermost scope, and the last is the outermost scope. Consider the following:

```js

function outside() {
  const x = 5;
  function inside(x) {
    return x * 2;
  }
  return inside;
}

console.log(outside()(10)); // 20 (instead of 10)

```

The name conflict happens at the statement return x * 2 and is between inside's parameter x and outside's variable x. The scope chain here is {inside, outside, global object}. Therefore, inside's x takes precedences over outside's x, and 20 (inside's x) is returned instead of 10 (outside's x).
